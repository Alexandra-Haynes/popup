        Before the deployment, I would never have imagined that in 2021 there would
        still be people living in mud huts or rag tents, who don't even have
        water, parents who leave home in search of work for less than a dollar a
        day and never return because they are simply in the wrong place at the
        wrong time. 
        <br>
        <br>I didn't know there were still places in this world where
        women are walking sheets. At meetings, we heard of soldiers freezing to
        death on post, soldiers asking for help to send a helicopter to drop
        bread from the helicopter, because they knew they couldn't land because
        the Taliban had surrounded and blocked the area. Soldiers who were left
        with their colleagues killed on post for days because they couldn't get
        to them to evacuate them, or with the desperate cries of wounded
        colleagues who couldn't be helped in any way. And yet some soldiers were
        not paid by the month even though their pay is very, very low. I won't
        talk about corruption, but I choose to talk about true patriotism, about
        fighting with one's life for a better future, which has not come from so
        many generations of soldiers in one's family, about putting oneself as a
        pawn on a chessboard with pieces of many colours, not just black and
        white. 
        <br>
        <br>Every day is a fight for survival and never is the night safer.
        Beyond the war, roads littered with explosive devices, rockets and
        terrorists, Afghans also struggle with hunger, poverty, disease, cold
        and heat. My phone rings every morning with more images of terrorists
        killed in air strikes or suicide bombers. I stared at those violent
        photos for minutes, stuck on the smile that would forever be plastered
        on their faces, convinced that they had died doing the right thing. Over
        time, we all forget that Afghanistan exists. And not just us, but the
        whole planet seems blind to this parallel world to the world we know,
        with these people guilty of being born into war... 
        <br>
        <br>I conclude my experience by saying just this: I would be afraid to be born again.
